# SPYS.ONE_SCRAPPER_CHROME_EXTENSION
This chrome extension helps scrap spys.one proxy IP Addresses with ease at one click for individual country page.

Problem : 
Spys.one provides free proxy IP addresses but one needs to copy each IP address individually. 
This is not feasible because not all proxies work so one needs to try/copy multiple IP addresses.

Solution :
This chrome extension works for spys.one country specific pages. It divides the IP addresses as per thier categories.
It makes it easy to copy them as per category or whole page via single button click.

How to install:
1. Go to Chrome Settings > Extensions
2. Enable Developer mode.
3. Click on "Load unpacked"
4. Select the folder containing the downloaded code.

How to use:
1. Visit country specific page
Example: Visit https://spys.one/free-proxy-list/US/ for US proxies
2. Launch the installed extension 
3. Copy the required category of IP address using the button above each category!

PS: I had coded this project in 2020 but forgot to upload it. It may break at some pages now in 2022 :)
